// ---- Cursor gaze (continuous) --------------------------------------------
// The Avatar Lab runtime has NO pointer/gaze tracking API (verified by
// grepping avatar-core, avatar-react and the Studio app: pointer events only
// drive the Studio's editor controls and 3D view orbit). So gaze-following is
// APPROXIMATED here, but continuously across the whole viewport: a rAF loop
// eases the cursor's position and writes a blended pose into the definition's
// 'gaze-live' expression slot (which the vendored runtime samples live every
// frame). The cursor position is normalized against the window halves, so any
// cursor angle maps to a blend of the two nearest lab glance expressions,
// scaled by distance toward neutral - the gaze direction is a continuous
// field over the entire screen, no fixed directions and no dead zone.

// ---- Inactivity emotion ladder -------------------------------------------

// never jumps straight to angry. Emotion is expressed ONLY through animation
// (no speech bubbles for tiers themselves); the one inactivity bubble fires
// once per boredom cycle, only when the final tier is reached, at the lowest
// priority. Any activity resets the timer and (if the ladder had climbed)
// triggers a surprised or happy reaction before settling back to idle.

// ---- Capability notes (verified against the lab, 2026-09) -----------------
// The canonical avatar source is the external bible-strong Avatar Lab.
//   * Sunee's definition comes from src/features/studio/defaultStudioDocument.json
//     (expressions 00-24 + 23 built-in sequences). This project's
//     sunee.avatar.json mirrors 21 of those expressions and 13 sequences,
//     verbatim (parameter-for-parameter); "talking" IS the lab's "excited",
//     renamed for its fact-bubble role.
//   * The runtime exposes play(key) / setExpression(key) / stop() / pause()
//     and samples definition.expressions[activeExpression] live every frame -
//     that live sampling is what the continuous gaze approximation writes to
//     (the 'gaze-live' slot + the 'gaze-follow' hold loop in sunee.avatar.json).
//   * No cursor/gaze/eye-tracking exists in the lab (packages or Studio app),
//     so that behavior is approximated, not reused. Everything else here maps
//     to real, verified sequences.
